- **Low Spending Areas**: Dental Services, Home Health Care, and Durable Medical Products.
- **Death Rate Decline**: Age-adjusted death rate dropped from 140 to 120 per 100,000, likely linked to increased spending.

**Insight**: More spending focuses on essential healthcare areas, leading to improved outcomes (lower death rates).
